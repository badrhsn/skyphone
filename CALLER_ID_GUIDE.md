# 📞 Caller ID Verification System - Complete Guide

## 🔍 How Verification Works

### Verification Methods
The system uses **two verification methods** with automatic fallback:

1. **SMS Verification** (Primary)
   - 6-digit code sent via text message
   - Faster and more convenient
   - Works on all phone types

2. **Voice Call Verification** (Fallback)
   - Automated call with spoken verification code
   - Used when SMS fails
   - Works for landlines and blocked SMS numbers

### Verification Process
```
1. User adds phone number → System generates 6-digit code
2. SMS sent first → If fails → Voice call made
3. User enters code → System verifies → Status: VERIFIED
4. Number becomes available in dialer
```

## 🎯 Integration with Dialer

### Caller ID Options in Dialer
The dialer now supports **4 caller ID types**:

1. **Public Numbers** (Default)
   - Company/service numbers
   - Standard rates apply

2. **Bought Numbers** (Premium)
   - Numbers purchased through the platform
   - Monthly fees apply
   - Professional appearance

3. **Verified Caller IDs** (NEW!)
   - User's own verified phone numbers
   - Custom rates may apply
   - Personal/business branding

4. **Custom Caller ID** (Manual)
   - User-entered number
   - No verification required
   - Higher risk of restrictions
