🔍 GOOGLE OAUTH TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
====================================

Based on the server logs, here's what's happening:

✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
1. Google OAuth initiation (POST /api/auth/signin/google)
2. Google callback success (GET /api/auth/callback/google with 302 redirect)
3. Session creation works

❌ THE PROBLEM:
After successful Google OAuth, the user is redirected back to /auth/signin instead of /dashboard

🔧 FIXES APPLIED:
1. Updated dashboard page to redirect admins to /admin automatically
2. Fixed auth redirect configuration
3. Updated middleware to not interfere with OAuth flow
4. Made session handling more robust

📋 TO TEST THE FIX:
==================

1. Make sure your development server is running:
   npm run dev

2. Open: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin

3. Click "Continue with Google"

4. Expected behavior after Google auth:
   - Regular users → redirected to /dashboard/dialer
   - Admin users → redirected to /admin

5. Check browser console for any errors

🛠️ IF STILL NOT WORKING:
=========================

1. Check Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Authorized redirect URIs must include:
     http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google

2. Clear browser cache and cookies for localhost:3000

3. Try incognito/private browsing mode

4. Check browser developer tools → Network tab during OAuth flow

🎯 VERIFICATION STEPS:
=====================

Test with these accounts:
- Regular user: Any Google account will create a new user with $5 balance
- Admin access: Use admin@yadaphone.com with credentials signin

The Google OAuth should now work correctly! 🚀
