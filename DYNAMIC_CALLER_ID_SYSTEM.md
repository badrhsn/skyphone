# 🎯 Dynamic "Call From" Dropdown - Smart & Adaptive

## ✅ **How It Works Now**

### 🧠 **Intelligent Detection System**
The system automatically checks what the user has and shows appropriate options:

```javascript
// System checks:
1. Does user have verified caller IDs? → Show them
2. Does user have bought numbers? → Show them  
3. Always show public numbers (platform numbers)
4. Show "add more" options where needed
```

## 📱 **Dynamic Dropdown Structure**
